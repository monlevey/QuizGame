## Usage
 The coding quiz guides the user in a fast paced game, a race against a countdown timer, to answer the quiz questions correctly. The quiz uses dynamically created HTML and CSS to update the questions, answers and styling according to the user input and ability to score correctly. Highscores are stored in local storage and sorted by fastest time. The coding quiz is responsive in both mobile and desktop view.
